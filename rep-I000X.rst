Motivation
========

Hardware interfaces are top-level priority in ROS-Industrial Roadmap [#ros-i_roadmap]_, however if not considering canopen package from IPA [#ros_canopen]_, there hasn't been any obvious progress in this field for quite a long time now. The goal of this project is therefore to develop a ROS-Profinet-wrapper for Siemens CP1616 - Profinet PCI card [#cp1616]_, in order to provide this progressive hardware interface to ROS-Industrial community. As the worldâ€™s most advanced open Industrial Ethernet solution we consider PROFINET in combination with existing PCI communication processors a viable way how to allow ROS-I systems to communicate with PLC's, HMIs, OPC servers and various industrial hardware. 


CP1616
========
Communication module Siemens CP1616 [#cp1616]_ enables PGs/PCs equipped with a PCI slot to be connected to PROFINET IO. Since CP 1616 offers the communication possibilities of both IO Controllers/IO Devices (master/slave), usage in various network configurations is possible.

From user point of view, CP1616 acts like a standard PROFINET IO device. STEP7 or Simatic NCM are used for a basic parametrization and topology setup, after which the configuration needs to be downloaded to CP1616 over the standard Ethernet. User's Linux (or other OS) application adresses existing configuration and access particular communication channels defined in SIMATIC project. 



Existing Linux SW for CP1616
========
DK-16xx PN IO is a software developemnt kit for integration of CP1616 module into various PCs  equipped by standard PCI slot. CP1616 driver and user IO Base library sourcecodes for Linux systems, as well as comprehensive documentation for porting to other OS is included. The kit is free of charge, it can be downloaded from Siemens support website [#siemens_sup]_ or ordered directly.  

The following graphic shows the software layers and communictation paths of DK-16xx PN IO software

Driver
---------

The driver is used to activate the CP1616 and to integrate the memory windows and IRQs of the CP1616 in the operating system. It 

 - processes interupts
 - maps the process image on the CP for the IO Base library
 - handles jobs between the IO Base library and the firmware on the CP
 
The following schematic shows the basic driver structure. The arrows indicate communications channels - ring buffers used for data exchange between driver and CP1616 firmware. The boxes above represent the device files (/dev) - driver access points for communication with user application. For additional details about driver functionality please refer to original documentation [#CP1616_doc]_ .

IO Base Library
---------

IO-Base user programming interface provides all basic functions that a C user program requires to communicate with PROFINET IO devices. These are read/write IO data, send/receive alarms confirmations and read/write data records. 

The IO-Base library covers all three methods of exchanging data in PROFINET network:

- Acyclic IO data exchange (NRT): used for non-deterministic functions such as parametrization, video/audio transmissions and data transfer to higher level IT systems.

- Cyclic non-isochronous real-time IO data traffic (RT): TCP/IP layers are bypassed in order to give deterministic performance for automation applications in the 1-10mS range. This represents a software-based solution for typical I/O applications, inluding motion control and high performance requirements.

- Cyclic isochronous real-time IO data traffic (IRT): signal prioritization and scheduled switching deliver high precision synchronization for applications such as motion control. Cycle rates in the sub millisecond range are possible, with jitter in sub-microsecond range. This service requires hardware support in the form of readily available ASICs (Application specific integrated circuit). 

All three methods can be used simultaneously. Bandwidth sharing ensures that at least 50% of every IO cycle remains available for TCP/IP communications, whatever other functionality is being supported as shown in following schematic.
